## üèó Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture with the following:

- `:app` -Umbrella for the application
- `:offer` - Feature module for offer-related functionality (aka the requirements for this sample)
- `:command` - Command pattern definition

  - `:test:mockclientfactory` - Mock/Fake client factory of Ktor
  - `:test:roborazzi` - Screenshot test utilities

## üõ† Technical Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture**: Declarative UI, Command Pattern and what is commonly know as Clean Architecture

## üì¶ Dependencies

The project uses version catalogs for dependency management:

- `runtime.versions.toml` - Runtime dependencies
- `build.versions.toml` - Build dependencies
- `test.versions.toml` - Testing dependencies

## üèó Build Configuration

The project uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL and includes:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
### Build and Development
- You might see a couple of warning - the project uses a outdated Spotless configuration
- The convention Plugins causeing some warning due to the dependency resolution
- You might encounter an issue that the OpenApi. In a few instances it happened that the infrastructure was deleted by the client generation.
 if this is the case please run `./gradlew openApiInfrastructureGenerate` which should resolve the problem.
